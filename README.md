# NeuralNetworkRacing (demo)

> [!NOTE]  
> I decided to remake this old project from scratch in C# and Godot, turning it into a **sandbox simulation game**.
> I've added new features like a **track editor and neural network editor**, with more to come!

> This code is a product of my early programming days. I've refactored it, but it might not align with current best practices.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èÔ∏è HOW TO RUN?

### Install packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

https://github.com/TomasBrezina/NeuralNetworkRacing/blob/e6ff65a77d38f0cdad01690a0a770a9eb9c2da2a/requirements.txt#L1-L3

### Run main file
Should work with ``Python 3.0`` and higher.

For example:

    py -3.10 .\__main__.py

Or use a virtual environment.

### Config (Optional)

**config.json**

    {
	    "width": 1280
	    "height": 720
	    "friction": 0.1
	    "render_timestep": 0.025 // time between frames in seconds - 0.025s = 40 FPS
	    "timeout_seconds": 30 // maximum time for each gen
	    "population": 40 // number of cars
	    "mutation_rate": 0.6 // mutation rate after gen
    }

**default_nn_config.json** - Default car config for new saves.  

    {
	    "name" : "test" 
	    "acceleration": 1
	    "friction": 0.95
	    "max_speed": 30 
	    "rotation_speed": 4
	    "shape": [6, 4, 3, 2] // neural network shape - do not change first and last layer
	    "max_score": 0
	    "gen_count": 0
    }

## üß¨ EVOLUTION
Best cars in each generation are chosen to be the parents of the next, slightly mutated generation.
